## parkrun

parkrun provide free weekly 5K races in parks and other public spaces, typically at 9am on Saturdays. parkrun is open to all abilities, including people new to running who may still need to walk the majority of the distance.

### What to expect at a parkrun

I was hesitant to run my local parkrun originally, because I didn't feel like I knew enough about what to expect on the day, so here's a quick summary.

Make sure you're registered at [parkrun.org.uk](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/) ([international links](https://www.parkrun.com/)) before your first parkrun. You only need to register once, and doing so will give you a unique barcode. Print this out and take it with you (they won't scan it from a phone) - you can't get your result registered without your barcode on the day.

On the day, plan to arrive about ten minutes before the start time. You don't need to register your intent to join a particular parkrun or register on arrival - just turn up. Wear whatever you are comformtable wearing. parkrun is very welcoming and friendly.

parkruns always have a first timers briefing about five minutes before race start. This is useful if you are new to parkrun, or simply new to the course and covers the general rules of parkrun as well as specifics about the course layout, whether it's an out and back, or a single or multi lap course. The start and place to gather to hear the first timers briefing will be announced, often over loudspeaker.

The first timers briefing is typically followed by a race briefing for everyone, covering things such as notable milestones (runners who may be running their 100th, 200th parkrun that day for instance), any alterations to the normal course, hazards such as muddy or slippery parts of the course.

At the end of the briefing, runners will typically be asked to make their way to the starting area. Depending on the course, this can be a fairly large start line where runners spread right out, or it can be fairly narrow where runners self organise into a funnel with faster runners further toward the front. Some particularly well organised events with narrow starts will even have a funnel system labeled with numbers (20, 25, 30, 35, etc) indicating roughly where you should start based on how many minutes you estimate you will need to complete the 5K.

There will be a claxon or bell or maybe just the race director shouting "go" from the start line, and then you run.

At the end of the race, you'll be "counted" as you cross the finish line, which then leads into a single-file funnel. If you left it all out on the course, you might want to collapse on the floor dramatically and take a moment, but there's no opportunity for that here. Stay in order relative to the person ahead and behind, and keep walking forward through the funnel. Calls of "keep moving forward" can often be heard in the vicinty of a parkrun finish funnel, where poor saps can be seen stumbling forward through the funnel following a particularly gruelling 5K. As you exit the funnel, you'll be given a token.

Get your barcode out, and take it with the token to a barcode scanning volunteer. They'll want the token first, which they then keep, then they'll scan your barcode second. Some time later that day your time will be sent to you, amking you an official parkrunner.
