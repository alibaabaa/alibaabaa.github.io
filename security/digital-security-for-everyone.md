## What is this and why does it matter?
It's my belief that everyone deserves the right to make use of online technology without being put at risk. When we make use of connected devices such as laptops, smartphones, and tablets, we deserve to know what the dangers are and how to limit the associated risks.

There's a lot of well-intentioned but ultimately unhelpful information going around about how we can protect ourselves when online.

What you will find here are steps that _everyone_ can and should take as a _bare minimum_.

You can't buy safety online. It's not an app you can install or a software package you can download. Be wary of any advice to the contrary.

For the vast majority of ordinary people, the only thing needed is basic behavioural change. That's all that I'll cover.

Things like websites and email are convenient and life-changing. But they also make us more vulnerable to nasties such as fraud and identity theft, and can ultimately lead to us losing control of our most personal information, and in some cases, our money.

Technology changes all the time, and so do the threats faced online. This list is kept up to date based on those changes.

As of now, there are just **two** things you should be doing. Doing just these two things will protect you from the vast majority of attacks that normal people fall victim to online.

## The most important steps

1. Don't share passwords between different sites.
2. Don't click on links in emails.

That really is it.

I'll cover those steps in more detail, but this is supposed to be for normal people, and normal people are busy and don't have the time or energy to commit to long reads on security in technology. I still believe there's a lot that people can gain from learning just a bit more, but at a bare minimum, there it is. Ultimately, I believe that it's our job as technologists to reduce the number of steps required to zero, but that's a post for another day.

So in more detail...
