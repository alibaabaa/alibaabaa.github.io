  <p>
    I am a Senior Product Security Engineer working to secure software and hardware solutions in the utility industry,
    solving global water security problems. I am <a
      href="https://certification.comptia.org/certifications/security">CompTIA
      Security+</a> certified.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before that, I was building solutions to digitise and deliver consumer product data to the largest supermarkets in
    the UK and across the world at <a href="//brandbank.com">Nielsen Brandbank</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also ran Paste Monitor, a free service that processed all public pastes to Pastebin and sent users alerts for
    matches against their search list. I discontinued the service when Pastebin shut down their API, making the solution
    no longer viable. You can read more about the background to Paste Monitor <a
      href="/paste-monitor-a-tracking-service">here</a> and read a technical overview <a
      href="/a-look-inside-pastemonitor">here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a qualified practising information security professional with more than a decade of software development
    experience, and two decades of building on the web, I possess a skill set ideally suited to application security and
    am lucky enough to be in a position to apply this expertise in my work.
